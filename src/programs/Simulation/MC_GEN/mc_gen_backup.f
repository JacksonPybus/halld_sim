        PROGRAM MC_GEN
c*********************************************************************************
c	MC_GEN
c	Monte Carlo generation of events with sequential N-body decays.
c
c	The topology of the events is this:
c	1 + 2(target) ---> 3 + 4
c			   3 ---> 5 + 6 + ... + n
c			       4 --->  n+1 + ...polv
c				etc...
c	The masses, etc, for particles are read in from a carefully-structured
c       file whose generic name is MC_GEN.DEF.  It is the "definition" file for the
c       process we will be simulating, a.k.a. a "configuration" file.
c
c	The top-level program MC_GEN is responsible for the generation of
c       events under the control of the input-file.  There are several subtroutines,
c       some of which are attached directly to this file and others that are 
c       separate.  A (very large) subroutine called MC_ANALYZE is (optionally)
c       called for each generated event to allow for fast on-the-spot analysis and
c       histogramming of the generated events.  
c
c       This program writes raw event output to external files in ASCII format  
c       for input to the JLab/GlueX standard GEANT package.
c       The optional analysis subroutine MC_ANALYZE creates and stores histograms 
c       in the HBOOK format for displaying with PAW or ROOT.

c               11-13-08 - found and fixed an old bug whereby txt2bos output sometimes
c                          ended after writing fewer than the specified number of events
c               11-18-08 - introduce a relativistic Breit-Wigner lineshape option
c                          this involves some programming chicanery with the sign of the 
c                          "width" of the particle to pick either a pure Lorentzian
c                          or a full relativistic BW
c                1-23-09 - Add a Sigma(1385) L=1 selection.  Some day these L -value
c                          selections should be coded into the .def files....
c                2-13-09 - Add "Particle 70" which is generated as a flat mass distribution
c                          between limits set by the nominal mass (low edge) and width 
c                          (high edge) parameters
c                3-18-09 - Added Lambda(1405) lineshape selection: when ctau=-1 read
c                          and use a table of values indexed into photon energy bins and
c                          decay cases Sigma+pi-, Sigma0pi0, Sigma-pi+.  The logic of the
c                          code in built in near the place where we also can select the 
c                          relativistic BW.  The new subroutine is 'lineshapepick'
c               10-30-09 - Added a 2-body phase-space weighting of the decay mass
c                          distribution for the case of eta_prime --> rho0 gamma.  The weighting
c                          is in proportion to the available decay momentum.  It is implemented
c                          using ndynamics=9
c               11-02-09 - Expanded the calculation of 2-body phase space momentum weighting
c                          to the cases of production of K+ Y* and K* Y.  This involves 
c                          weighting by the ratio of output c.m. momentum to input c.m. momentum.
c                          It is turned on using ndynamics = 10 or 11. 
c                3-26-10 - lengthen name of output files.  Now it can be up to 150 characters (!)
c                3-18-11 - insert an extra call to RAN to tweak the sequence of random numbers
c                        - fix bug in Lambda(1405) special case: ctau = -1 flag that was used for
c                          making lineshape selection correct also caused 1405 to have ctau = 1cm!                    
c                4-15-11 - added an IPRULE=11 for the x(1280) production case
c                8-09-13 - added 4 and 5 -body phase space decays for which P1 is forced to 
c                          have <PFERMI recoil momentum
c               11-05-13 - tweak the algorithm for having one "broad" state decay into another
c                          "broad" state.  Relates to the study of L(1520) --> S(1385) pi
c               12-03-13 - for IPRULE=7, change the recoil particle from being always a ground 
c                          state Lambda to being whatever it really is in the decay list.
c                4-07-14 - add routine REGGEPICK_RHO to mimic rho photoproduction a la 
c                          Donnachie and Landshof;  goes with IPRULE=13
c                9-04-15 - start the recovery process from a disk crash and loss of changes since
c                          the end of May of this year.
c                9-05-14 - introduce Hulthen momentum distribution for quasi-free breakup of deuteron
c               12-18-14 - allow the initial state to include a neutron in Fermi motion.  This 
c                          is the first time the code allows a non-stationary initial target.
c                          The subroutine getdeuteronmomentum(p) was written
c                5-15-14 - Make several 4-vectors of length 5 to put total energy in element 5
c                9-30-15 - modify write-out list to write out photons and pi0 4-vectors (for BoGa runs)
c                        - some code tweaks to satisfy the gfortran compiler on the Mac 
c         	 6-26-17 - tweaks to allow Lambda anti-Lambda events to be generated
c                7-27-17 - big move to compute "Regge" decay in the particle-decay part of the code
c                          rather than in the particle-generation part of the code
c               11-28-17 - Read in the "shape" of the raw beam photon spectrum from a file
c                2-08-18 - Add bits to allow Lambda p --> Lambda p scattering
c                5-25-18 - Updates to Lambda-anti-Lambda code for event generation

c                6-16-19 - Code to read in a GlueX beam flux file from outside
c       Fission of MC_GENERATOR into two programs;  this one is MC_GEN which generates events but
c                          only optionally analyzes events
c                6-26-19 - Develop MC_GEN, with the goal of making a stand-alone generator
c                          with no event analysis included.        
c                7-12-19 - reexport the program to the CMU central computers
c                          to run larger-scale simulations on computer clusters

c	   If we are decaying to a particle which has a significant width,
c	   now is the time to pick its rest mass.  This approach
c	   neglects many complications due to phase space distortions
c	   and the presence of decay thresholds for some cases.
c	   The branching ratios are not adjusted according to the masses
c	   that are picked nor their relation to decay thresholds.
c
c	   For Gaussian, WIDTH should be the sigma value.
c	   For Breit-Wigner, WIDTH should be Gamma/2.
c
c	   If switching from Gaussian to Breit-Wigner, be sure to
c	   change the definition of WIDTH, above.
c
 	   iwidthflag = .false.	!tells us whether ANY decay particle has a width
c
c          First treat the special case that the particle is ID number "100",
c          in which case we create its width as a "box" of constant
c          density and defined boundaries.  Use the nominal mass and 
c          width parameters to define the boundaries of the box.
c
c          We have no good way to control the L of the decay lineshape
c          This is a piece of pure hackery:  if the decaying particle is
c          the Lambda(1520) (indexed as the 59th particle in the decay table), 
c          set L=2, else make it L=0. 
c
c          Also treat the special case of the Lambda(1405) decaying to
c          Sigma pi with a *different lineshape* in each decay mode
c
c          On top of everything else, we have to do this for each of the two particles
c          that are decaying at this stage, the KKth and the JJth particles.  Use IX as the index.

c       GETMASSES
c
c       This routine gets the masses of the first two-body decay mode of 
c       the particle indexed by 'index' in the particle table.  This involves
c       indexing carefully into the array that holds all the particle decay 
c       information.
c       
c	Bad programming practice: the PARAMETER variables are not in an 
c       include file, so there is a danger of screwing up the indexing
c       if the values of maxnumpar or maxdecays changes in the main program.
c
c       Inputs:
c          Index - the ordinal number specifying which particle in the input
c                  list of all particles is wanted.
c          iflag - 1 finds the particle's decay masses 
c                  0 on first call, finds the particle's decay masses
c                    while on later calls the routine merely returns what
c                    was previously found.
c       Outputs:
c          rm1   - mass of the FIRST two-body decay mode particle for the
c                  particle indexed by 'index'

c     Read in the actual experimental distribution of beam photons, a "flux file"
c     The code was written using a specific file for Spring 2017 data, it has 1000 channels, with
c     two columns: bin centers in GeV and counts at that beam energy.
c     The bin width is 10 MeV or .010 GeV.
c     Not clear is whether the given energies are the bin centers or the low edges.
c     There are lots of bins with zero counts, not only below channel 426 (6.255 GeV)
c     and above channel 944 (11.435 GeV), but in between.   That is because the
c     tagger has gaps in it outside the range of the microscope.  Thus, there is a
