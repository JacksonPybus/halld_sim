project_moments_polarized.cpp  code can be used to calculate polarized moments using the fitted amplitudes from AmpTools.

In this code one loops through directories corresponding to different M and t bins, retrieves the complex amplitudes corresponding
to different amplitudes from fit resuls, claculates the moments using the expressions A9 and D8 from Mathiew et. al. paper and writes the 
information in the output file. First line in the output file lists the name of the variables in each colomn and the proceeding lines correspond to different M and t bins. The name of the output file should be given as an argument with option -o. To run the code one needs to go to the directory that contains the directory "etaprimepi0" with folders containing fit results for different M and t bins and run the code the following way:

project_moments_polarized -o etaprimepi0_moments_newcode.txt 


Note that one needs to set the waveset used in the fitting in the project_moments_polarized. And the order of the waves in the waveset should be the same as the one in the fit.cfg used in fitting. 

The function that calculated the moments is defined in moment.cpp and is called
decomposeMoment(int alpha ,double L, double M, const waveset& ws, const vector<double>& x). First argument alpha takes values 0,1,2,3 depending on the moment one wants to obtain. L and M for the moment to be calculated, ws waveset and the vector of the real and imaginary components of the waves from fit corresponding to the waves in the waveset.
