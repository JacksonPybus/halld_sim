This code is based on the codes by Vincent Mathiew. It calculates moments in terms of fitted partial waves for general case (all walues of epsilon and M and waves).
The function that returns the moments is called Moments_refl(). One should also add the amplitudes used in fitting in the pw_refl() function.
The calculation is done based on equations A9 and D8 from Mathiew et. al.
