This code can be used for calculating the moment in terms of fitted partial amplitudes  using explicit formulas given in Appendix E of Mathiew 
et. al. paper on "Moments of angular distribution and beam asymmetries in eta pi0 photoproduction at
GlueX". The calculation is done for M>0, positive reflectivity and SPD waveset, but can be used for any waveset with waves up to D. In this case IM(H2(LM))=-H1(LM). H3 moments can not be accessed
with linearly polarized photon beam.
